      <h1>Conclusions</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">  For our business to prosper on social media like Instagram, it is important to analyze what actions give us a higher Influence Score. Our influencer score would dictate our effectiveness of spreading our posts, increasing our follower count, and the amount of people that would see us in general. By researching what actions increase our influencer score, we can prioritize those actions to see results. Our original question which metric most positively affects the Influencer Score. We garnered our data from the crowd-sourced data website Kaggle, and imported it into our workspace. We then isolate which metrics we were looking at, which resulted in just Influence Score, Followers, Average Likes per Post, Total Posts, and Total Likes. We then graphed each one compared to Influence score, and the graphs could be found above. To further analyze their correlations, we calculated their Pearson Correlation Coefficient and included them above as well. Unfortunately, all of the graphs are relatively inconclusive, and their PCCs are also not strong enough to show a correlation between any of them. It seems that perhaps all of these individual metrics don't individually determine the Influencer Score alone, but a combination of them do. I recommend that we prioritize gaining followers, making daily posts, and trying to strive for higher like counts (perhaps through ads or sponsors). To further this analysis, it would be very helpful to see how the Influencer Score is calculated so we see which variables increase it the most, but solely from our Kaggle data, this is all we can currently deduce.</h5>
