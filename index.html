    <p>Getting informed consent—permission from patients before medical procedures—is more than a checkbox. It involves conveying medical information clearly, a challenge in the limited time of medical visits. Navigating this requires acknowledging the complexity, embracing different ethical approaches, and learning from real-world stories of moral excellence.</p>
