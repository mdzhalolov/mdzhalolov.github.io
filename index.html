      <h1>Conclusions</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">  After a recent downturn of profits quarter after quarter, Netflix has been seeking to create a new action movie project to help recuperate from these losses, and continue business as usual. To make sure this project is successful, we need to the 10 directors who have made the movies with the most revenue in history. To start, we gathered our data from TMDB's API, a reputable database on movies and TV shows. We first gathered the list of the top 1000 movies in revenue, and then garnered the director and actual revenue amount for each movie. We then made the graph above to better visualize our top 10. Overall, there are 2 clear candidates for the job; James Cameron and Joe Russo. They appear twice in the top 10 and top 5, and each of their movies have pulled over 2 billion dollars. This is not to bash the other 6 directors, as they have also done major accomplishments. It is possible that some of these directos may have just gotten lucky, and hit big with their revenue. We would redo this project, but look at the average revenue for each director for all of their movies. Perhaps Netflix would prefer a safer choice with a director who can consistently bring good results instead of occasionally bringing excellent results.</h5>
