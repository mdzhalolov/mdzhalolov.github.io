      <h1>Conclusions</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Investing in second world developing countries can help support economic growth and development, offer potential for high returns, and promote social and environmental sustainability. We decided to answer the question of which countries have had the most numerous highest GDP growths from 1961 to 2020. We garnered our data from the crowd-sourced dataset website Kaggle about the GDP of various countries that have consistenty existed from 1961-2020. Then, for each year, we found the country with the highest GDP gain ratio, and gave them a "point". For example, Oman had the most GDP growth ratio for 5 different years. We have seen a extremely strong indicator that second world countries who are actively developing have shown the most GDP growth. Notable countries include Oman, Iraq, Equatorial Guinea, Azerbaijan, Nauru and Libya. I do not think there are significant threats to validity other than user error. Perhaps the data-set creator didn't adjust for inflation when calculating GDP's, or they left out some countries, but from my view, I don't see any major issues. Overall, it is clear that our new international startup should be established in one of these second world countries that are rapidly developing. Their huge economic growth can reflect on our financial part of our business and bring us more profits. As their country grows, so will our business.'  </h5>
